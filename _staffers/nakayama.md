Hi there! I'm a 1st year computer science PhD student. My research involves exploring the intersection of computer languages, operating systems, and computer architecture. I'm fascinated by how these three domains shape the way we interact with computers and how we can improve them for the future. I was born and raised in LA County, where I enjoyed the sunny weather and the diverse culture. When I'm not busy with research or coursework, I like to cook delicious meals, take photos of nature, cities and people, and program for fun. I'm always eager to learn new things and meet new people, so feel free to reach out to me anytime! I hope you enjoy this class, and please feel
free to stop by my office hours if you have any questions.
