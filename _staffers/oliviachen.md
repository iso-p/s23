Hi y'all! Welcome to CSW8! My name is Olivia Chen, and I am a first-year undergraduate student. I am exploring different computer science fields like machine learning with UCSB Data Science Club. What made me really enjoy computer science at UC Santa Barbara was actually CSW8. 
After two years of programming in Java, learning Python from the professors in the CS department cleared up a lot of confusion I had with fundamental concepts. 
I now enjoy learning about data structures and memory allocation in my other computer science courses because the problems seem intimidating at first, but each problem is a learning curve that will make you surprised at what you can do.
Outside of school, I love to dance, explore Isla Vista on my bike, and go to the beach. I am excited to be a ULA for this course and looking forward to meeting all of you!
