The textbook for this course is an online book on the [zyBooks.com](https://zybooks.com) platform.

The chief advantage of this book is that the reading assignments are
integrated with practice problems where you can immediately check
whether you have understood what you read.

It is required; there are required assignments each week starting with the first one, so you need to
purchase it by the first day of class, {{page.first_day}}.  The cost is $77.

* Create an account at <https://learn.zybooks.com> using your UCSB email of the form `username@ucsb.edu`
* You'll see the following. Enter zyBook code `{{ page.zybooks_code }}`
